# Weather_Time_ESP32
I created project to get and diplay the weather and time values ​​up to the present moment. 
This project contains 2 business logics: 1 to display the time, 2 to get and display the current weather. 
Each process is allocated 1 flow of board capacity. These streams work in parallel
